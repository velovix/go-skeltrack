go-skeltrack
============

A Go binding for the Skeltrack library by Joaquim Rocha.

Skeltrack is a C library that attempts to track a human skeleton using depth
data retrieved from a device such as a Kinect.

This binding attempts to make Skeltrack Go-like without sacraficing too much
familiarity with the original library. Take a look at the examples to get an
idea of how the binding works.
